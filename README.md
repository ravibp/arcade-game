===============================

##Getting Started

This is a game that I made to work like the classic game Frogger. To play the game, download all of the files and open the index.html file with your browser.

##Controls

There are only 4 buttons that this game will register. The direction keys on your keyboard are the only keys that will do anything. 'Up' will move the character up one space. 'Down' will move the character down one space. 'Right' will move the character right one space. 'Left' will move the character left one space. That is unless you are near a rock. The character cannot move through the rocks.

##Objective

The objective of the game is to make it to the water without touching any of the bugs. If you touch a bug, you will respawn where you started. When you reach the water, you will respawn where you started, as will all of the bugs.
